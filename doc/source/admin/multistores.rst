Multi Store Support
===================

.. note:: The Multi Store feature was introduced as EXPERIMENTAL in Rocky
          and is now fully supported in the Train release.

Scope of this document
----------------------

This page describes how to enable multiple stores in glance.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Glance version 17.0.0 or Later

* Glance Store Library 0.25.0 or Later

* Glance not using the Glance Registry

* Available backends

Procedure
---------

In this section, we discuss what configuration options are available to
operators to enable multiple stores support.

* in the ``[DEFAULT]`` options group:

  * ``enabled_backends`` must be set as a key:value pair where key
    represents the identifier for the store and value will be the type
    of the store. Valid values are one of ``file``, ``http``, ``rbd``,
    ``swift``, ``cinder``, ``sheepdog`` or ``vmware``. In order to have
    multiple stores operator can specify multiple key:value separated by
    comma.

    .. warning::
       The store identifier prefix ``os_glance_`` is reserved.  If you
       define a store identifier with this prefix, the glance service will
       refuse to start.

    The http store type is always treated by Glance as a read-only
    store.  This is indicated in the response to the ``/v2/stores/info``
    call, where an http type store will have the attribute ``read-only:
    True`` in addition to the usual ``id`` and ``description`` fields.

    .. code-block:: ini

         [DEFAULT]
         enabled_backends = fast:rbd, cheap:rbd, shared:file, reliable:file

* in the ``[glance_store]`` options group:

  * ``default_backend`` must be set to one of the identifier which are defined
    using ``enabled_backends`` option. If ``default_backend`` is not set or if
    it is not representing one of the valid store drivers then it will prevent
    glance api service from starting.

    .. code-block:: ini

         [glance_store]
         default_backend = fast

* For each of the store identifier defined in ``enabled_backends`` section
  operator needs to add a new config group which will define config options
  related to that particular store.

  .. code-block:: ini

        [shared]
        filesystem_store_datadir = /opt/stack/data/glance/shared_images/
        store_description = "Shared filesystem store"

        [reliable]
        filesystem_store_datadir = /opt/stack/data/glance/reliable
        store_description = "Reliable filesystem backend"

        [fast]
        store_description = "Fast rbd backend"
        rbd_store_chunk_size = 8
        rbd_store_pool = images
        rbd_store_user = admin
        rbd_store_ceph_conf = /etc/ceph/ceph.conf
        rados_connect_timeout = 0

        [cheap]
        store_description = "Cheap rbd backend"
        rbd_store_chunk_size = 8
        rbd_store_pool = images
        rbd_store_user = admin
        rbd_store_ceph_conf = /etc/ceph/ceph1.conf
        rados_connect_timeout = 0

  .. note ::
       ``store_description`` is a new config option added to each store where
       operator can add meaningful description about that store. This
       description is displayed in the GET /v2/info/stores response.

Store Configuration Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please keep the following points in mind.

* Due to the special read only nature and characteristics of the
  http store type, configuring multiple instances of the http type
  store **is not supported**.  (This constraint is not currently
  enforced in the code.)

* Each instance of the filesystem store **must** have a different value
  for the ``filesystem_store_datadir``.  (This constraint is not currently
  enforced in the code.)


Reserved Stores
---------------

With the Train release, Glance is beginning a transition from its former
reliance upon local directories for temporary data storage to the ability
to use backend stores accessed via the glance_store library.

In the Train release, the use of backend stores for this purpose is optional
**unless you are using the multi store support feature**.  Since you are
reading this document, this situation most likely applies to you.

.. note::
   Currently, only the filesystem store type is supported as a Glance
   reserved store.

The reserved stores are not intended to be exposed to end users.  Thus
they will not appear in the response to the store discovery call, GET
/v2/info/stores, or as values in the ``OpenStack-image-store-ids``
response header of the image-create call.

You do not get to select the name of a reserved store; these are defined
by Glance and begin with the prefix ``os_glance_``.  In the Train release,
you do not get to select the store type: all reserved stores must be of
type filesystem.

Currently, there are two reserved stores:

``os_glance_tasks_store``
    This store is used for the tasks engine.  It replaces the use of the
    DEPRECATED configuration option ``[task]/work_dir``.

``os_glance_staging_store``
    This store is used for the staging area for the interoperable image
    import process.  It replaces  the use of the DEPRECATED configuration
    option ``[DEFAULT]/node_staging_uri``.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned above, you do not get to select the name or the type of
a reserved store (though we anticipate that you will be able configure
the store type in a future release).

The reserved stores *must* be of type filesystem.  Hence, you must
provide configuration for them in your ``glance-api.conf`` file.  You
do this by introducing a section in ``glance-api.conf`` for each reserved
store as follows:

.. code-block:: ini

    [os_glance_tasks_store]
    filesystem_store_datadir = /var/lib/glance/tasks_work_dir

    [os_glance_staging_store]
    filesystem_store_datadir = /var/lib/glance/staging

Since these are both filesystem stores (remember, you do not get a choice)
the only option you must configure for each is the
``filesystem_store_datadir``.  Please keep the following points in mind:

* The path for ``filesystem_store_datadir`` used for the reserved
  stores must be **different** from the path you are using for
  any filesystem store you have listed in ``enabled_backends``.
  Using the same data directory for multiple filesystem stores is
  **unsupported** and may lead to data loss.

* The identifiers for reserved stores, that is, ``os_glance_tasks_store``
  and ``os_glance_staging_store``, must **not** be included in the
  ``enabled_backends`` list.

* The reserved stores will **not** appear in the store discovery response
  or as values in the ``OpenStack-image-store-ids`` response header of
  the image-create call.

* The reserved stores will **not** be accepted as the value of the
  ``X-Image-Meta-Store`` header on the image-data-upload call or
  the image-import call.
