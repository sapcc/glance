The amount of time, in seconds, to delay image scrubbing.

When delayed delete is turned on, an image is put into ``pending_delete``
state upon deletion until the scrubber deletes its image data. Typically, soon
after the image is put into ``pending_delete`` state, it is available for
scrubbing. However, scrubbing can be delayed until a later point using this
configuration option. This option denotes the time period an image spends in
``pending_delete`` state before it is available for scrubbing.

It is important to realize that this has storage implications. The larger the
``scrub_time``, the longer the time to reclaim backend storage from deleted
images.

Turn on/off delayed delete.

Typically when an image is deleted, the ``glance-api`` service puts the image
into ``deleted`` state and deletes its data at the same time. Delayed delete
is a feature in Glance that delays the actual deletion of image data until a
later point in time (as determined by the configuration option ``scrub_time``).
When delayed delete is turned on, the ``glance-api`` service puts the image
into ``pending_delete`` state upon deletion and leaves the image data in the
storage backend for the image scrubber to delete at a later time. The image
scrubber will move the image into ``deleted`` state upon successful deletion
of image data.

NOTE: When delayed delete is turned on, image scrubber MUST be running as a
periodic task to prevent the backend storage from filling up with undesired
usage.
