    A new common image property, 'description', has been added.  This
    allows you to specify a brief human-readable description, suitable
    for display in a user interface, on images.  It has been possible
    to do this previously using a custom image property; this change
    simply standardizes the usage in order to promote interoperability.
    This change has no effect on any property named 'description' on
    existing images, and it is not a required image property.
