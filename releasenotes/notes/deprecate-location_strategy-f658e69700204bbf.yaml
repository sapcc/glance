deprecations:
  - |
    The Glance API configuration options ``location_strategy`` and
    ``store_type_preference`` are deprecated in this release and are subject to
    removal at the beginning of the Dalmatian development cycle, following the
    `OpenStack standard deprecation policy
    <https://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/assert_follows-standard-deprecation.html>`_.

    The weighing mechanism introduced in the Bobcat development cycle can be
    used by operators who would like to prioritize certain stores over others.
