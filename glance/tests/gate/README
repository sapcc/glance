Gate-only tests
===============

These tests catch configuration problems for some code constants that
must be maintained manually.  We have them separated out from the other
tests so that they can easily be run in their own gate job and don't
affect local development.

It would be nice if someone with some free time could figure out how
to make these changes automatic (or unnecessary) ...
