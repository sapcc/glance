  Stein release cycle has been without major changes to the Images API, this
  release does not introduce new Images API minor version.

  Some work has been done on Windows compatibility and Glance Stein release
  is compatible running on Windows platform. Future development will be also
  gated on Windows based on 3rd party CI model.

  Due to some unresolved issues on consuming multiple backends work the
  stabilization of the feature has been pushed to Train and will stay
  EXPERIMENTAL on Stein.

  fixes. Please refer the rest of the release notes and docs for details.
